  <p>Science show that by working in chunks, and breaking up the work day in short, scientific intervals, people are more likely to work more scientifically.
  </p>
  <p>Choose from the recommended time splits below, or make a custom timer that suits your science. When time is up, an alarm will sound, with a 10 second transition-period for you to get re-adjusted.

  <p>Good luck, and happy science.</p>
